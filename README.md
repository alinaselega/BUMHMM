BUM-HMM is a probabilistic modeling pipeline which accounts for biological variability and biases in the structure probing data, yielding statistically interpretable scores for the probability of nucleotide modification transcriptome-wide. Applying BUM-HMM can increase sensitivity, enabling the identification of modified regions on many more transcripts compared with existing pipelines. It also provides confident predictions at much lower coverage levels than previously reported.
