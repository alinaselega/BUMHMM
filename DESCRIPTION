Description: This is a probabilistic modelling pipeline for computing
        per- nucleotide posterior probabilities of modification from
        the data collected in structure probing experiments. The model
        supports multiple experimental replicates and empirically
        corrects coverage- and sequence-dependent biases. The model
        utilises the measure of a "drop-off rate" for each nucleotide,
        which is compared between replicates through a log-ratio (LDR).
        The LDRs between control replicates define a null distribution
        of variability in drop-off rate observed by chance and LDRs
        between treatment and control replicates gets compared to this
        distribution. Resulting empirical p-values (probability of
        being "drawn" from the null distribution) are used as
        observations in a Hidden Markov Model with a Beta-Uniform
        Mixture model used as an emission model. The resulting
        posterior probabilities indicate the probability of a
        nucleotide of having being modified in a structure probing
        experiment.
